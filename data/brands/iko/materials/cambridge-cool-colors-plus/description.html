  <li><strong>Fiberglass Core Strength:</strong> Built with a resilient fiberglass mat core for enhanced durability and long-term performance.</li>
  <li><strong>True Square Advantage:</strong> Larger-sized shingles provide greater coverage than many competitors' comparable products, reducing installation time and material costs.</li>
